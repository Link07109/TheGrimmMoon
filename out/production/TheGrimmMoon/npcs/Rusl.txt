Tell me... Do you ever feel a strange sadness as dusk falls?
They say it's the only time when our world intersects with theirs...
...The only time we can feel the lingering regrets of spirits who have left our world.
That is why loneliness always pervades the hour of twilight...
But enough talk of sadness... I have a favor to ask of you, {name}.
I was supposed to go on a mission tomorrow...
Yes, it was a task set to me by the king, but...would you go in my stead?
You have...never been to Lothric, right?
In the kingdom of Lothric there is a great castle, and around it is the town of Deva.
You should look upon it all with your own eyes.
It is getting late... We should head back to the castle. I will talk to the king about this matter.

The king has approved of you going in my stead.
He expects great things of you.
Don't let him down.
Take a few guards with you, for there's strength in numbers.

Nice work, didn't think you had the guts to go through with it.
This will serve us well for many years to come.
